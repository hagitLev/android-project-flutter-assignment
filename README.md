# Dry3:


*1.	What class is used to implement the controller pattern in this library? What features does it allow the developer to control?*
  - The class that is used is the SnappingSheetController(). It allows the developer to control the position of the snapping sheet by getting the current position, set a     new one or stop it.

*2.	The library allows the bottom sheet to snap into position with various
animations. What parameter controls this behavior?*
  - the snappingCurve parameter

*3.	Name one advantage of InkWell over the latter and one advantage of GestureDetector over the first.*
  - InkWell can decorate the widget in a better way of graphics effects when tapped than GestureDetector.
    However, InkWell cannot be used if it doesnâ€™t have Material widget as its ancestor, while GestureDetector can.
    The GestureDetector has much more features of gestures than InkWell and deals better with size fitting.
